Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Schmidt

I am a full stack developer working at [DOCUFY](https://docufy.de) developing solutions for the needs of our customers concerning technical documentation.
In my day job I mainly work with Java, Spring, MS SQL Server, RCP and XSLT.

On GitHub however, you will only find my private projects, where I like to try other languages and frameworks.
