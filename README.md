Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Schmidt

I am a full stack developer discussing and implementing technical documentation solutions for the needs of our customers.
In my day job I mainly work with Java, Spring, MS SQL Server, RCP and XSLT.

On GitHub however, you will only find my private projects, where I like to try other languages and frameworks.
